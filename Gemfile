ruby RUBY_VERSION

# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# gem "jekyll", "3.2.1"

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
gem "minima"

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
# gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# As of v1.3.0, Jekyll uses the listen gem to watch 
# for changes when the --watch switch is specified during 
# a build or serve. While listen has built-in support 
# for UNIX systems, it requires an extra gem for compatibility 
# with Windows. Add the following to the Gemfile for your site:
gem 'wdm', '~> 0.1.0' if Gem.win_platform?

# Jekyll plugin to silently generate a sitemaps.org 
# compliant sitemap for your Jekyll site
# gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
# A Jekyll plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and 
# administer Jekyll sites. The project is divided into two parts. A Ruby-based HTTP API that handles Jekyll 
# and filesystem operations, and a Javascript-based front end, built on that API.
# gem 'jekyll-admin', group: :jekyll_plugins

# @mentionable support for your Jekyll site
# gem 'jekyll-mentions'

# A Jekyll plugin to generate an Atom (RSS-like) feed of your Jekyll posts
# gem 'jekyll-feed'

# A Jekyll plugin to add metadata tags for search engines and social networks to better 
# index and display your site's content.
# gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'

# GitHub-flavored Emoji plugin for Jekyll
# gem 'jemoji'
