My name is Julius Krah and I am a software engineer. I started this blog to share my software engineering experiences and what
I have learned in my career as an engineer.  
I am a Senior software engineer at Super Tech (STL) Limited. I love to **write code** and **write about what I code**.

I contribute to open source and you can find my open source contributions on
{% include icon-github.html username=site.github_username %} /
[GitHub]({{ site.github.url }}/{{ site.github_username }}){:target="_blank"} and
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/{{ site.github_username }}){:target="_blank"}
